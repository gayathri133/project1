    <h1>What is communication?</h1>
    <p><big><u>Communication</big></u> is simply <em>the act of transferring information</em>from one place, person or group to another.<i>  Every communication involves (at least) one sender,</i> a message and a recipient. This may sound simple, but communication is actually a very complex subject.</p>
   <p>The <b>transmission</b> of the message <strong><mark>from sender to recipient</mark></strong> can be affected by a huge range of things. <small>These include our emotions, the cultural situation, the medium used to communicate</small>, and even our location. The complexity is why good communication skills are considered so desirable by employers around the world: accurate, effective and unambiguous communication is actually extremely hard.
